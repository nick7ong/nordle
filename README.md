# nordle
A simple terminal clone of the popular word game Wordle (the “N” is for “Nick”)
Coded entirely in C++ using only the standard library directories and no externally imported header files
The goal with this project was to create a project entirely from scratch using little to no help from the internet and applying only what I’ve learned in class so far
